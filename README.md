# Customer Management Form Geo Project

## Overview
[cite_start]This project, developed during my internship at GeoLens Technology[cite: 16], is an ongoing effort to create a dynamic and responsive customer management form using Angular. It aims to enhance user experience and streamline data input, with continuous development to incorporate additional functionalities.

## Current Features
* [cite_start]**Dynamic Customer Form:** Engineered using standalone Angular components, increasing code reusability by 40%[cite: 32].
* [cite_start]**Reactive Forms with Validation:** Integrated for robust input validation, reducing input errors and form re-submissions by 60%[cite: 33].
* [cite_start]**Responsive UI/UX:** Designed with Angular Material to provide an enhanced multi-device user experience by 80%[cite: 34].
* [cite_start]**Secure API Integration:** Incorporated secure APIs using JWT (JSON Web Tokens), boosting backend security by 35%[cite: 20].

## Technologies Used
* [cite_start]**Angular:** Core framework for building the front-end application[cite: 24].
* [cite_start]**Node.js:** Backend runtime environment[cite: 24].
* [cite_start]**TypeScript:** Primary language for Angular development[cite: 24].
* [cite_start]**RxJS:** Used for reactive programming[cite: 24].
* [cite_start]**Angular Material:** UI component library[cite: 24].
* [cite_start]**JWT (JSON Web Tokens):** For secure authentication[cite: 11].
* [cite_start]**Jira:** For project task collaboration[cite: 10, 21].

## Development Milestones & Learning
[cite_start]This project has been a significant part of my internship[cite: 17], allowing me to apply and enhance my skills. Key achievements include:
* [cite_start]Improved UI performance by 25% by building Angular components and forms[cite: 18].
* [cite_start]Reduced form errors by 30% with Reactive Forms and validations[cite: 19].
* [cite_start]Boosted backend security by 35% through integrated secure APIs using JWT[cite: 20].
* [cite_start]Maintained a 100% sprint completion rate through collaboration on project tasks using Jira[cite: 21].
* [cite_start]Increased code reusability by 40% using standalone Angular components[cite: 32].
* [cite_start]Enhanced multi-device user experience by 80% with a responsive Angular Material UI layout[cite: 34].
[cite_start]My code for this project is versioned and published on GitHub for transparency and collaboration[cite: 47].

## Future Enhancements (Planned Features)
* User authentication and authorisation modules.
* Integration with a backend database for persistent data storage.
* Advanced search and filtering capabilities for customer data.
* Ability to edit and delete customer records.
* Reporting features for customer insights.

# Customer Management Form Geo Project

## Overview
This project, developed during my internship at GeoLens Technology[cite: 16], is an ongoing effort to create a dynamic and responsive customer management form using Angular. It aims to enhance user experience and streamline data input, with continuous development to incorporate additional functionalities.

## Current Features
*  **Dynamic Customer Form:** Engineered using standalone Angular components, increasing code reusability by 40% .
*  **Reactive Forms with Validation:** Integrated for robust input validation, reducing input errors and form re-submissions by 60% .
* **Responsive UI/UX:** Designed with Angular Material to provide an enhanced multi-device user experience by 80% .
*  **Secure API Integration:** Incorporated secure APIs using JWT (JSON Web Tokens), boosting backend security by 35% .

## Technologies Used
* **Angular:** Core framework for building the front-end application .
* **Node.js:** Backend runtime environment .
* **TypeScript:** Primary language for Angular development .
* **RxJS:** Used for reactive programming .
* **Angular Material:** UI component library .
* **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):** For secure authentication.
* **Jira:** For project task collaboration .

## Development Milestones & Learning
This project has been a significant part of my internship[cite: 17], allowing me to apply and enhance my skills. Key achievements include:
* Improved UI performance by 25% by building Angular components and forms.
* Reduced form errors by 30% with Reactive Forms and validations.
* Boosted backend security by 35% through integrated secure APIs using JWT.
